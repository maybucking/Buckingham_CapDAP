This data set contains data collected by Kealey Viglielmo for a study on American Kestrel nesting box success by Susan Willson, James R. Chandler, Carol Cady, and Mark Manske. The specific data set that I am using contains data of 154 nesting boxes from the years 2002 to 2013. The data contains the number of years the box is up, percent nest success, number of chicks banded, and box inhabitants.
